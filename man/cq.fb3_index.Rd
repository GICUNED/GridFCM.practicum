\title{Calculation of consequence and feedback negative effects for each construct of the
system}
\usage{
cq.fb3_index(wimp, std = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{wimp}{An object of class 'wimp', which contains an implication grid and associated constructs.}

\item{std}{A logical value indicating whether to standarize the scores (TRUE) or (FALSE)}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with the intensity of negative effects caused by consequences and feedback interactions
}
\description{
This function calculates the intensity of negative effects of consequences and feedbacks
for each construct to analyze its resistance to change
