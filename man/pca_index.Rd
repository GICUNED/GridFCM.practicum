\title{Calculate centrality scores based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}
\usage{
pca_index(wimp, method = "implications", pr.comp = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{wimp}{A list object representing the WIMP structure, which must include
a scores list with matrices: direct, weights, and implications.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying which wimp matrix to use for PCA.
Valid options are "direct", "weights", or "implications".}

\item{pr.comp}{Integer indicating the number of principal components to use
for calculating centrality scores. Defaults to 2.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with construct names and their centrality scores.
}
\description{
This function computes centrality scores for constructs in a WIMP object using
PCA on a specified matrix (direct, weights, or implications). It returns the centrality scores
based on the loadings of the specified number of principal components.
}
\examples{
pca_index(my_wimp, method = "weights", pr.comp = 2)
